# OperatingSystemsProject1

Project is setup as a Console app for C#, make sure that you have a .NET framework installed before testing
Linux commands are used at some points, so you will get errors if you try and use it on a windows or mac device


Unsure if this is really an issue but when doing test runs sometimes it takes a couple of attempts for a deadlock situation to happen
